Instructions on how to use the SQL Scripts.

Execute the Final Path Consulting Database Scripts first. 
The script will first drop all foreign key constraints, create tables, populate bulk data, create primary keys, and lastly create foreign keys. 

At the end of the script there are two triggers that will allow for soft deletes for the Klaus Brewing Location Table and Coupon Table. The soft delete will only occur if a delete is completed with each respective table's primary key. The soft deletes are there for educational purposes.

You can test the individual reports in any order you like. My preferred order is AKukoyi, CLazard, FKhan, JIzuebu, PAsarpota, STran, and SQuintanilla. 

The scripts can be ran consecutively, but it is recommended to execute the Final Path Consulting Database Scripts between each individual script's execution as the reports will be more complete.
